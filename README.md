Silver: Simple Voting DApp

A decentralized voting application designed to provide a secure, transparent, and user-friendly platform for creating and participating in polls. Votes are recorded in a decentralized manner on the blockchain, ensuring immutability and transparency. This application is built using Web3 technologies, making it compatible with any blockchain supporting smart contracts.

Key Features:

Smart Contract written in Solidity for secure and transparent voting.

Frontend built with React and shadcn/ui for a seamless user experience.

No Backend or Database: Fully decentralized solution utilizing Web3 technologies.

Decentralized Randomness: Uses verifiable randomness to ensure fairness in actions like auditing and rewards.


Getting Started:

1. Deploy the smart contract from smart_contracts/VotingContract.sol.


2. Copy the contract address and ABI into VotingApp.jsx.


3. Run the frontend:

npm install
npm run dev



Why Verifiable Randomness?

Fairness: Ensures that any randomization process (such as selecting auditors or distributing rewards) is transparent and tamper-proof.

Security: Uses decentralized oracles and services for secure operations.


Future Enhancements:

Token Rewards: Integration with token-based reward systems for participants.

Automation: Using decentralized services for automated voting tasks.

Project Motivation:

The Silver Voting App provides a decentralized, transparent voting system for any Web3-enabled blockchain. It aims to ensure fairness, security, and transparency in decentralized governance and voting processes.
